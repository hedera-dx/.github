## Hedera Dx - On a mission to simplify cancer testing

### Life-saving information for cancer patients when it matters most
1 in 3 people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime (according to cancer.org). To get the best possible treatment, it is critical to detect cancer when it matters most. Hedera Dx was born to give access to life-saving information for patients suffering from cancer. Co-founded in 2021 by Tommi Lehtonen, Damien Lapray and Christian Meisel, Hedera Dx is a fast growing and passionate startup employing 15+ people across Europe. We are building a liquid biopsy cancer testing solution for hospital laboratories that enables an instant and easy adoption of liquid biopsies, i.e. blood-based cancer tests.

### We're hiring

Our team is helping more patients have better outcomes by making liquid biopsies a reality in clinical practice.

### Our Culture
Our culture is based on thinking differently, being ambitious, being benevolent and being human, basically being ourselves. This goes into everything we do: from how we develop our products, the way we work and who we hire. Beyond the complexity and seriousness of what we aim to solve, we make sure to enjoy on a daily basis what we do, how we work together and celebrate our success as a team. If you want to have a feel for our team, you’re warmly welcome to drop by our office in Switzerland for a coffee (it’s on us) or to connect with us remotely to chat with our team.
